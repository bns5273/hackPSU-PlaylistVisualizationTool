# hackPSU-PlaylistVisualizationTool

This was a project that I and a partner came up with and implemented during the Fall 2018 Penn State hackPSU overnight event. This project uses the Spotify API to download music playlist information from the entered user account, and creates various visualizations from the data.

After the competition I continued to develop the project. I would like to turn it into a web tool at some point in the future.
